            Cascading Style Sheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should
            start learning after HTML. While HTML is used to define the
            structure and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style it and
            lay it out. For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color,
            size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns,
            or add animations and other decorative features.

            You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS. We
            recommend that you work through our
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML"
              target="_blank"
              >Introduction to HTML</a

            module first.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you
            learn further HTML and CSS at the same time, moving back and forth
            between the two topics. This is because HTML is far more interesting
            and much more fun to learn when you apply CSS, and you can't learn
            CSS without knowing HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before starting this topic, you should also be familiar with using
            computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it,
            consuming the content). You should have a basic work environment set
            up, as detailed in

                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web
                pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing
                of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add
                animations and other decorative features. This module provides a
                gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the
                basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you
                can start using it to add styling to HTML.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>CSS syntax: </strong>CSS is a rule-based language — you
                define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be
                applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web
                page.
              </p>
              <p>
                The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would
                achieve the styling described above:
              </p>
              <code> h1 { color: red; font-size: 5em; } </code>
              <p>
                A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after
                the other.
              </p>
              <p>
                <code
                  >h1 { color: red; font-size: 5em; } p { color: black; }
                </code>
              </p>

                left off — now you've gained familiarity with the language and
                its syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, it's
                time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and
                inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units,
                sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots
                more.

                The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing
                competent CSS and help you understand all the essential theory,

                <strong>Type, class, and ID selectors: </strong>Type selectors
                target an HTML element such as:
                <code> h1 { } </code>
              </p>
              <p>
                Class selectors target an element that has a specific value for
                its class attribute:
                <code>.box { } </code>
              </p>
              <p>
                ID selectors target an element that has a specific value for its
                id attribute:

                With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic
                for you to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most
                common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling
                fundamentals, including setting font, boldness, italics, line
                and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. We
                round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your
                page, and styling lists and links.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>color</strong> can accept any CSS color unit, for
                example:
                <code>p { color: red; } </code>
              </p>
              <p>
                To set a different font for your text, you use the
                <strong>font-family</strong> property
                <code>p { font-family: Arial; } </code>
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dt id="css_layout">
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout"
                target="_blank"
                >CSS layout</a
              >
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                At this point, we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to
                style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your
                content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your
                boxes in the right place with respect to the viewport, and one
                another. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so we can
                now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display
                settings, modern layout tools like:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Normal flow: Elements on webpages lay themselves out according
                  to normal flow - until we do something to change that.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Flexbox: Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying
                  out items in rows or columns.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Grids: CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for
                  the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns, and
                  has many features that make building complex layouts
                  straightforward.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Floats: Originally for floating images inside blocks of text,
                  the float property became one of the most commonly used tools
                  for creating multiple column layouts on webpages. With the
                  advent of Flexbox and Grid it has now returned to its original
                  purpose.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Positioning: Positioning allows you to take elements out of
                  the normal document layout flow and make them behave
                  differently, for example, by sitting on top of one another, or
                  by always remaining in the same place inside the browser
                  viewport.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Multiple-column layout: The multiple-column layout
                  specification gives you a method of laying content out in
                  columns, as you might see in a newspaper.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Responsive design: As more diverse screen sizes have appeared
                  on web-enabled devices, the concept of responsive web design
                  (RWD) has appeared: a set of practices that allows web pages
                  to alter their layout and appearance to suit different screen
                  widths, resolutions, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  CSS Media Query: The CSS Media Query gives you a way to apply
                  CSS only when the browser and device environment matches a
                  rule that you specify, for example, "viewport is wider than
                  480 pixels". Media queries are a key part of responsive web
                  design because they allow you to create different layouts
                  depending on the size of the viewport.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Legacy layout methods: Grid systems are a very common feature
                  used in CSS layouts. Prior to CSS Grid Layout, they tended to
                  be implemented using floats or other layout features.

            From the beginning, you'll primarily apply colors to HTML elements
            and their backgrounds; change the size, shape, and position of
            elements; and add and define borders on elements. But there's not
            much you can't do once you have a solid understanding of even the
            basics of CSS. One of the best things about learning CSS is that
            once you know the fundamentals, usually you have a pretty good feel
            for what can and can't be done, even if you don't know how to do it
            yet!

            CSS works a bit differently from most programming languages and
            design tools you'll come across. Why does it work the way it does?
            In the following video, Miriam Suzanne provides a useful explanation
            of why CSS works as it does, and why it has evolved as it has:

                CSS language. Want to know all the values a property can take?
